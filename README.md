## Q & A

<details> <summary> <b>Why use Rokit over Foreman or Aftman?</b> </summary>

### For a new Roblox developer

Rokit is the _fastest_ and _friendliest_ way to get set up with tooling for a new Roblox project. <br/>
Installation is completely automated and you do not need to manually edit any files to get your tools working.

### For everyone else

Foreman and Aftman both have an uncertain future as toolchain managers for the community. <br/>
Most of the existing problems boil down to issues with maintainership:

- Foreman is maintained by Roblox itself.
- Aftman is maintained by a third party that is no longer interested in Roblox.

Rokit aims to solve this by taking a community-first approach and being built with community contributions in mind, and also acknowledges that developers will not migrate from any of the existing toolchain managers _just because_. Rokit needs to be **_substantially better_**.

<details> <summary> <b>How do you pronounce Rokit?</b> </summary>

### However you want.

- "Rocket" for speed
- "Ro-kit" for Roblox-y flair
- "Rock-it" if you're feeling groovy
